# continuum_hr_prod

Full Stack Coding Challenge:

Create a simple, small HR web application written in Angular (or something similar) for the
front-end and Node.js for the backend. The data can be stored in whatever way you choose.

The application should allow you to enter employee names, salary information, deductions, and perform some calculations for their pay based on the information input.
